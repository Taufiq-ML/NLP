Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis with NLP

Welcome to the Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis project! This repository contains code for classifying restaurant reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The classifier is built using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for its robustness in handling high-dimensional data.

Overview
In this project, we aim to classify restaurant reviews based on their sentiment using machine learning techniques. By analyzing textual data, we can automatically determine whether a review expresses positive or negative sentiment towards a restaurant.
